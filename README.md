## Tools

### Forensic: initial-triage
Initial triage is a python program that helps retrieve the basic information during forensic analysis, it requires a dump file as an input.
It creates text files as outputs named after the volatility command in a folder named "result_initial_triage".

requirements: volatility2 installed and working as a cmdline > $ volatility -f ...

usage: python3 initial_triage.py (memory dump file)

## Ideas

initial-triage: make a version for volatility2 and 3, the current one works with volatility2 only.

Put the cache files of chrome,firefox,ie in the sub-folder browser
## Notes

The background color is `#ffffff` for light mode and `#000000` for dark mode.
